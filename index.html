  I am a theoretical physicist with broad interests in quantum field theory and string theory,
  their relation and connections to quantum gravity.
  In particular, I have worked in formal / non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric and superconformal field theories,
  as well as in the swampland program to constrain theories of quantum gravity.
  <br>
  More details on my research are here.
  A current list of publication can be found on

  I am also interested in other disciplines related to modern technology.
  I have always enjoyted programming and have experience with C, C++, Python, R.
  Back in the day, my first inclination was to be a computer scientis.
  <nr>
  I am now enjoying the seemingly endless possibilities that Data and the AI and machine learning 
  technologies, that have now become immeditaly accesisble, can offer.<br>
  I am exanding my experience in this sector with several Data Analysis and Data Science
  specific activities.
  </p>
<p>
   I am also interested and invested (pun intended) in finance and the stock market and look forward 
  to apply the above skills to this sector.
</p>

On the non technical side, 
I am a fitness enthusiast, I have run 3 marathons and plan (maybe!) to do more.
 Currently focusing more on weightlifting.
<br>
  I also enjoy learning foreign languages as a means to interact with and undestand better
   people from all parts of the world. I am fluent in Italian, English, Spanish.
   I should also put in Friulano, though I practically never use it.
   I can get by with French and probably Portuguese.
   The remaining ones are a bit ... questionable.
