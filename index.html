  I am a theoretical physicist with broad interests in quantum field theories and their connections to gravity.
  I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher 
  in the Center for Theoretical Physics at Seoul National University, in South Korea.
</p><p>
  My work focuses around formal aspects of quantum field theory and string theory.
  At the moment I am thinking about constructions of field theories 
  arising from string theory that lead to QFTs with enhanced symmetries.
  Constraining and classifying moduli spaces of vacua of 4d N=2 superconformal field theories 
  has been an ongoing endeavor in recent time, following the work of Seiberg and Witten. 
  After classifying the possible Coulomb Branch geometries at rank 1, 
  I am interested in continuing the exploration further.
  I am also working on understanding the profound effect that non local operators have on QFTs. 
  These lead to a variety of interesting algebraic structures that we have only recently 
  started exploring as a community (higher form symmetries, n-group symmetries).
  I am involved in refining some constraints in the realm of the swampland program, 
  in particular using string theory constraints to systematically fix ideas about 
  the weak gravity conjecture.
</p><p>
  Besides physics, I have a collection of varied interests, more or less related to the hard sciences.
  I am currently having fun honing my programming skills (Python/C++), with the goal of finding 
  applications to Data Analysis, as well as AI and Machine Learning.
</p><p>
  I also am a fitness enthusiast, I have run 3 marathons and plan (maybe!) to do more.
</p><p>
  I also enjoy learning foreign languages as a means to interact with and undestand better
   people from all parts of the world. I am fluent in Italian, English, Spanish.
   I should also put in Friulano, though I practically never use it.
   I can get by with French and probably Portuguese.
   And I have dipped my toes in German, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, ...
