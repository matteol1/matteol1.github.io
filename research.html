        I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher 
        in the Center for Theoretical Physics at Seoul National University, in South Korea.
      <br>
      My physics upbringing started in Rome, Italy where I completed a Laurea Triennale 
      and a Laurea Magistrale in Physcis, morally the equivalent of a Bachelor's and a Master's degre.
      <br>
      Later on, I moved to the University of Cincinnati, 
      where I completed my doctoral studies under the supervision of Philip Argyres.
        <br>
        I was a postdoc at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2018-2022).
      <br>
      
        My work focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory and string theory.
        <br>
        In particular I am interested in the deep connections between these theories 
        and the algebraic and geometrical structures that can be associated to them, which in tun 
        make it possible to study these theories with sophisticaed mathematical tools (that are 
         not available for a generic quantum field theory).
         <br>
         <ul>
            <li>
                During my doctorate, we carried out a systematic classifcation of a special family of
                 superconformal field theories, called rank-1 4d N=2 SCFTs.
                <br>
                While the classification at rank-1 theories was a tremendous success,
                 a lot remains to be done to generalize the srory.
                 Rank denotes the complex dimension of a component of the moduli space of these theoreis.
                 <br>
                 The hope is that there is a way to generalize the tools that we have used at rank-1,
                  or use different methods, for instance, exploiting 
                  notions of generalized symmetries, etc., that were developed in parallel or after our work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have worked on constructions of superconformal theories from brane engineering.
                    <br>
                    What we have produced was a proof of principle of the methods
                    and I am looking forward to continue these constructions further, 
                    again including, if possible, recent notions of symmetries, that may enrich the story.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additional structures, that supersymmetric and syperconformal
                     field theories can be endowed with, can arise from the presence of 
                     exetended operators in these theories.
                     <br>
                     A recent work that I have produced is to extend a well-known connections
                      between 4d N=2 SCFTs and 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs) by including 
                      line and surgace operators.
                      I believe this can generalized in a multitutde of irections 
                      and will uncover very interesting properties of these theories.
                </li>
        <li>
            In the realm of string theory and the swampland program, I have recently produced 
            a worldsheet proof of the constraints for the weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) showing 
            that this should hold in every effective theory obtained as the low energy 
            limit of string theory. A lot remains to be done here, to refine
             the story and connect it to many of the other conjectures that have been put forth.
