    My personal and professional experience has been shaped by the variety of
    environments in which I had the fortune of living.<br><br>
   
    <br>I was born in the northeast of Italy, close to the borders with Austria and Slovenia.
    Historivally, a strategic border land, from Roma times to the Austro-Hungarian empure and further to modern Italian history.
     has contributed in making the people from the area tough and ready to face the challenges of life.
     <br>
     The region is politically organized as Friuli Venezia Giulia, however this is a somewhat artificial political artifact.<be>
        "Furlans" (endonym of the people in the local language) feel unlike people from the Venezia or the Giulia parts of the region.
         - and are in fact bitter that the capital of the region is Trieste, rather than Udine.
    I grew up in this region, being exposed to Italian, Friulian, the regional language, and German, from the multited of tourists coming down to the 
    seaside from Austria and Germnay during the summers. Moerover, dye to the proximity, in elementary school I was taught German, rather than English, 
    as it is customary in other parts of Italy.
    <br>

    After elementary school, my family and I were shipped to Madrid, Spain following my father's job.
    We spent three years in Spain. There, I quickly became proficient in Spanish. Even though I was attending an Italian schhol, 
    most of my classmates were Spanish. This "forced" me to get in tune with the language rather quickly.
    <br>
    After the long Spanish parenthesis, we moved back to Italy, but now went to live in Rome.
        This, again, was a big change, many aspects are diffferent when comparing a smaller city in the northeast to the capital in the center o our peninsula.
        Here was another big chunk of my upbringing, I studied in high school and university in Rome.
        The former, in particular, has had a considerable impact on my Italian accent, you know the having to fir in and all...<br>
    <br>
    After these various bits of European life, I set sail west, but not following the usual trade routes and landed in Cincinnati, OH,
    where I spent five years during my doctoral studies.<br>
        Here, TBC<br>
